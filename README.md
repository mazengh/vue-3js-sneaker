# vue-3js-sneaker

> A three.js rendered canvas controlled by Vue.js 

Sample running demo at https://mazengh.github.io/vue-3js-sneaker

vue-3js-scneaker is example of integrating three.js 3D library into Vue.js to render and interact with 3D
shapes and models.

The application architecture exploits the power of renderless components and scoped slots to provide a declarative approach of defining a 3D scene from Vue components in a template. The application can be furthur improved by using a 3D model that has well defined UVs which provide better targets for updating specific areas in the model.
